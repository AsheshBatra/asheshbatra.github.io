I made a art gallery in 1st sprint, In 2nd sprint 2, I have made a data entry form, where it collects bunch of data from user.
It asks user for Name, Email, and contact number. After those details, Form asks user whether user has bought art from our gallery or not, 
it gives user 2 options: yes or no. 

If user chooses yes then it asks user for 			
1.Artist Name 
2.Art Name
3.Are satisfied with our service.

then user can just submit form with "submit" button.


If user chooses no then it asks user for
1.Are you intrested in our art?
2.Any additional message?

then user can just submit form with "submit" button.

The purpose of this is that if user has purchased our art, we can know if user is satisfied with his purchase or not.
however if user hasn't purchased art from us, we can know if he is intrested in purchasing art, and that user would count as a potential lead and our service 
can get in touch with user for purchase.
